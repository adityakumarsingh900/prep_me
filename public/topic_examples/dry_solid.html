  <h1>SOLID Principles</h1>
  <p><strong>SOLID</strong> is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>S (Single Responsibility Principle)</strong>: A class should have only one reason to change. This means a class should only have one job or responsibility.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>O (Open/Closed Principle)</strong>: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>L (Liskov Substitution Principle)</strong>: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This means that if a program is using a base class, it should be able to use any of its subclasses without the program knowing or behaving incorrectly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>I (Interface Segregation Principle)</strong>: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that a class should not have to implement methods it doesnâ€™t use.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>D (Dependency Inversion Principle)</strong>: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This means that you should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Applying these principles can help you create more robust, maintainable code. However, like any principles, they're not hard and fast rules, and there may be situations where it makes sense to deviate from them.</p>

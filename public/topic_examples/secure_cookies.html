  <strong>Secure Cookies</strong>
  <p>you can set a secure cookie by appending ; Secure to the cookie string when you use document.cookie:</p>
  <pre><code>
    document.cookie = "name=value; Secure";
  </code></pre>
  <p>The Secure flag only works over HTTPS</p>
  <p>The SameSite attribute is also recommended to prevent the cookie from being sent in cross-site requests, which can help to protect against CSRF attacks.</p>
  <pre><code>
    document.cookie = "name=value; SameSite=Strict";
  </code></pre>
